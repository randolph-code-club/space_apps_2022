Biological Hero is a text-based adventure game that simulates the hazardous conditions of space travel. It's a fun way for students to learn the struggles astronauts face.
This is a project for [NASA's Space Apps Challenge 2022](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/), for the [Biological Superhero challenge](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/space-biology-superhero/details) (hence the name).

## How to play

In this game, the player creates a biological superhero for the all-important purpose of retrieving your wallet from Mars.
Your character will have 5 stats, based on the [5 Hazards of Human Spaceflight](https://www.nasa.gov/hrp/5-hazards-of-human-spaceflight).
The game interprets these hazards as these 5 biological superpowers:
- resistance to radiation
- ability to be alone and stay mentally healthy
- ability to survive with little nourishment
- ability to retain bodily health in low/no gravity environments
- ease of happiness in otherwise harsh environments
Once your character has been created, you follow them on a mission to Mars with three chapters: on the way, there, and back again.
